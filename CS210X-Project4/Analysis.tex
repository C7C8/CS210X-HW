	\maketitle

	Our team ID is 1036. Data structures from 0-4 (inclusive) were used
	and are presented here in order.

	\section{Data Structure 0 -- Binary Tree}

	[Graphs here]

	We conclude that this data structure is a binary tree based on its
	perfect log time for adding and its similarly logaritmic time for
	removal.
	\section{Data Structure 1 -- Heap}

	[Graphs here]

	This data structure is most likely a heap as evidenced by its roughly
	logaritmic add time and its perfectly flat time (i.e. O(1)) for removal
	of the first element.

	\section{Data Structure 2 -- Linked List}

	[Graphs here]

	This data structure is probably a linked list based on its O(1) time to
	add and its O(n) time to remove.

	\section{Data Structure 3 -- Hash Set}

	[Graphs here]

	This data structure is almost certainly a hash set as it runs in O(1)
	time for operations.

	\section{Data Structure 4 -- Linked List}
	
	[Graphs here]

	This data structure appears to be the same as data structure \#2, as it
	exhibits similar behavior.
